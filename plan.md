# Real-Time Two-Player Frontend Refactor Plan

## Notes
- The frontend is being refactored from HTTP/fetch to WebSocket/socket.io for real-time, two-player gameplay.
- The HomeScreen component will now manage the WebSocket connection, handle real-time game state, and update the UI for both players.
- All fetch logic is replaced by socket event emitters and listeners.
- UI now displays opponent status, turn information, and handles real-time updates.
- All TypeScript and lint errors resolved; app ready for browser-based multiplayer testing.
- New requirement: Support multiple concurrent games (rooms) and named users. Players must choose a game name (ID) and a username before joining/creating a game. Backend and frontend both require significant updates to support this.
- Backend now handles player disconnects without crashing, using a removePlayer method.
- When a player attempts an invalid move, an alert is shown and the player can try again (not disconnected).
- New requirement: From home page, allow player to choose multiplayer or play alone with computer.
- Unified game state (`GameView`) now used for both single and multiplayer modes.
- Created shared `types.ts` and reusable `Card.tsx` component to resolve import/type errors.
- Client and server socket event names are now aligned (`createRoom`, `joinRoom`, `roomCreated`).
- Fixed: Infinite loop on multiplayer game creation by correcting useEffect dependencies in game.tsx.
- Fixed: Single-player 'Draw Card' button now works (UI correctly identifies local player).
- New requirement: Support more than 2 players per room, with turn order rotating among all players.
- UI requirement: Only the host sees the "Start Game" button; other players see only the player list in the lobby.
- BUG: When host clicks Start Game, UI does not update for all players; fix lobby-to-game transition for all players.
- New requirement: When a player leaves, remove them from the game state and continue to the next player.
- BUG: Endless loop of game creation when user creates a game.
- BUG: First join attempt says "not found"; user must join a second time.
- BUG: Host no longer sees Start Game button in lobby.
- Root cause: WebSocket connection is torn down and recreated on URL change, causing host/client state loss and join failures.
- BUG: Creating a game enters loading state and nothing happens.
- BUG: Player list text color in lobby is unreadable on web before game starts.
- UI requirement: Card designs should show icons (suit/symbol), not just text.
- New requirement: Add a red and black joker to the deck and display them with appropriate icons/colors.
- New rule: Joker can be played on any card, and any card can be played on a Joker.
- New requirement: Add a "pass turn" optionâ€”after drawing, player must explicitly pass to end their turn; do not auto-advance.
- New rule: If a player plays K, they must immediately play another card if possible, or else draw another card before passing turn.
